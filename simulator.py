"""Python sample for connecting to Google Cloud IoT Core via MQTT, using JWT.
This example connects to Google Cloud IoT Core via MQTT, using a JWT for device
authentication. After connecting, by default the device publishes 100 messages
to the device's MQTT topic at a rate of one per second, and then exits.
Before you run the sample, you must follow the instructions in the README
for this sample.
